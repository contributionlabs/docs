# 🤝 Third-party activity integration
<Tip>DeForm has a list of first-party activities that can be done in the DeForm
Campaigns platform. However in order to support any kind of activities, we offer
the ability to create an activity with any custom API.</Tip>

### 🔑 Auth

Your API should not require any auth and should be an open API endpoint. In the future, we plan to allow custom headers required for the API (ex: API keys).

### 🎟️ Input / Request

<Tip>⚙️ Whenever a DeForm Campaigns user verifies doing an activity on the platform, our backend will make a request to your open API endpoint with the below data.</Tip>

**URL**: `https://<domain>/<path>?<static query params>`

**Query params**

- your own custom static query params (ex: `requiredPts=50`)
- identity query params (depending on which identities you pick to identify a unique user, we will call the API with one or more of these query params)
    - `evmAddress` (ex: `0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045`)
    - `farcasterFid` (unique Farcaster FID - ex: `12345`)

**Example request (unique identity = `evmAddress`)**

```
https://game.deform.cc/points?requiredPts=50&evmAddress=0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```

### 🚪 Output / Response

<Warning>We expect a particular response format from your open API endpoint. We will throw a 500 error if we detect any response that doesn’t conform to the below format.</Warning>

**Response Schema**

```json
type ActivityCheckResponse = {
    // optional error object to provide more context
    error?: {
        // any error code that you define
        code: string | number;
        // user-facing error message that we will show the user for more context
        message: string;
    };
    data: {
        // whether the user has successfully completed the activity
        result: boolean;
    };
};
```

**Example (Success)**

```json
{
     "data": {
         "result”: true
     }
}
```

**Example (Failure)**
```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "ACTIVITY_INCOMPLETE",
        "message": "You only have 49 points."
     },
     "data": {
         "result”: false
     }
}
```
