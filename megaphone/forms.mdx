Megaphone forms can be accessed directly at https://app.deform.cc/.

<Note>
We are in the process of migrating DeForm users to Megaphone.

Any timeline and workflow changes that impact DeForm users will be communicated
here on this docs page.

If you are exploring DeForm for your use case, you may want to consider
launching a Megaphone page instead. DM @thatguyintech on Telegram or Twitter
with any questions and we'll get back to you ASAP.
</Note>

Here is an example of a simple form that we use at Megaphone to collect waitlist responses
for our Token Distribution features: https://waitlist.megaphone.xyz
