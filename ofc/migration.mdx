# FAQ

### 1. What is the OneFootball Club Pre-TGE Portal?

It is the community hub for OFC fans to find the latest news, participate in quests, and claim their ⚽️ BALLS from previous seasons ahead of the next important milestone: TGE. Check the official OFC announcements on [X](https://x.com/ofc_the_club).

### 2. I’ve never participated in OFC campaigns but want to join. What do I do?

You can begin your journey now by signing up on the [OFC
Portal](https://app.megaphone.xyz/pages/onefootballclub).

### 3. I have multiple accounts on OFC  S1 and S2. How do I claim my ⚽️ BALLS?

Using multiple accounts to farm points is a violation of the OFC and Megaphone terms and conditions. For the Pre-TGE portal, pick one account to import BALLS into the new Megaphone page. The rest of the BALLS do not count.

Note: you can only import **ONE** wallet address and this cannot be undone. If you used multiple accounts to participate previously (which you shouldn’t have), pick wisely, as you will not be able to import points from multiple wallets.

### 4. How do I know which wallet to use to claim my ⚽️ BALLS?

You should use the wallet you used in past Season 1 and Season 2 campaigns. You
can verify your wallet by visiting either the S1 or S2 campaigns and logging in
with the same wallet you used during those campaigns.

- OFC Season 1 campaign: https://ofc.onefootball.com/s1
- OFC Season 2 campaign: https://ofc.onefootball.com/s2

If you are unable to log in with a specific wallet, that means this wallet does not exist in the Megaphone system due to one of the following reasons:

- It was never used in past campaigns.
- It was removed due to suspicious sybil activity, bot behavior, or for violating our terms.

### 5. I just claimed my ⚽️ BALLS. Why is there a different amount than what I saw on S1 and S2 camapigns?

After S1 and S2 campaigns ended, we worked with the OFC team to detect bots and
sybil accounts and remove them from the system. This process was done to ensure
fairness and prevent abuse. As part of the cleanup, activity verifications and
BALLS rewards were consolidated. The OFC and Megaphone teams will continue to
monitor platform activity and may adjust with further rebalancing if more bots
are detected.
