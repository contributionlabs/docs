# FAQ

### 1. What is the OneFootball Club Pre-TGE Portal?

It is the community hub for OFC fans to find the latest news, participate in
quests, and claim their ⚽️ BALLS ahead of the next important milestone: TGE.
Check the official OFC announcements on [X](https://x.com/ofc_the_club).

### 2. I’ve never participated in OFC campaigns but want to join. What do I do?

You can begin your journey now by signing up on the [OFC
Portal](https://app.megaphone.xyz/pages/onefootballclub).

### 3. I have multiple accounts on OFC Season 1 and Season 2. How do I claim my ⚽️ BALLS?

Using multiple accounts to farm points is a violation of the OFC and Megaphone
terms and conditions. For the Pre-TGE portal, pick one account to import BALLS
into the new Megaphone page. The rest of the BALLS will forfeited.

### 4. How do I know which wallet to use to claim my ⚽️ BALLS?

You should use the wallet you used in past Season 1 and Season 2 campaigns. You
can verify your wallet by visiting either the S1 or S2 campaigns and logging in
with the same wallet you used during those campaigns.

- OFC Season 2 campaign: https://ofc.onefootball.com/s2

### 5. I just claimed my ⚽️ BALLS. Why is there a different amount than what I saw on S1 and S2 camapigns?

After S1 and S2 campaigns ended, we worked with the OFC team to detect bots and
sybil accounts and remove them from the system. This process was done to ensure
fairness and prevent abuse. As part of the cleanup, activity verifications and
BALLS rewards were consolidated. The OFC and Megaphone teams will continue to
monitor platform activity and may adjust with further rebalancing if more bots
are detected.
