1. Chain and token address
2. Snapshot of token holders (See the example csv file above)
   - `address`: wallet addresses of the allowlisted addresses
   - `allocation`: the total allocation for each address, denominated in the token's decimals (i.e. 6 decimals for USDC, 18 decimals for ETH)
   - `eligibilityCriteria1`, `eligibilityCriteria2`, etc.: breakdown of reasons for the allocation (i.e. "Pudgy Penguin NFT Holder", "Bought boba with crypto")
3. Admin wallet address: this is the wallet address that will be allowed to withdraw any unclaimed tokens after the airdrop is over.
