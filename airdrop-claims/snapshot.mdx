1. Chain and token address
2. Snapshot of token holders (See the example csv file above)
    - `address`: wallet addresses of the allowlisted addresses
    - `allocation`: the total allocation for each address, denominated in the token's decimals (i.e. 6 decimals for USDC, 18 decimals for ETH)
    - `eligibilityCriteria1`, `eligibilityCriteria2`, etc.: breakdown of reasons for the allocation (i.e. "Pudgy Penguin NFT Holder", "Bought boba with crypto")
3. Admin wallet address: this is the wallet address that will be allowed to withdraw any unclaimed tokens after the airdrop is over.

Once we have deployed your distribution contract, we will coordinate with you to
deposit funds into the contract to finalize your claim setup.
