4. Background image (optional, we'll display your background color if you don't provide one)

1. Title ("Say hi to Megaphone")
2. Description ("Drop a comment on our X page to get future bonuses!")
3. Image asset

### Reward Page
1. Token Symbol (i.e. "PENGU" or "USDC")
2. Eligibility Criteria (i.e. "Pudgy Penguin NFT Holder", "Bought boba with crypto")
