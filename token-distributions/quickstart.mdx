## Demo

To see what a Megaphone airdrop claim experience looks like, check out our demo claim flow here: https://app.megaphone.xyz/claims/demo

You can also see a screen by screen breakdown of the demo claim flow below:

#### Intro Page
The intro page is the first page that users see when they land on your claim page. It's a great place to share context about why you're doing the airdrop, token distribution, or rewards distribution and to showcase your brand.

#### Allocation Checker Page
On the allocation checker page, users will paste in their wallet address to check if they're eligible for the airdrop claim.

#### Reward Display Page
If the user is eligible for the airdrop, they will see their allocation displayed in a nice card. The criteria for eligibility and rewards breakdown can be configured based on the snapshot you provide to us during setup.

#### Claim Page
When the user is ready to claim, they will accept the terms and conditions, and then execute a claim transaction.

#### (Optional) Video Advertisement During Transaction Processing
You can optionally show a video to your users during the transaction processing. This is a really fun way to keep your community engaged and excited during the transaction processing.

#### Success Page
The success page is the final page that users see after they've successfully claimed their tokens. It's a great place to thank your users for their participation, share next steps, and showcase an optional commemorative NFT mint (powered by Megaphone).
