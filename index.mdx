Our mission at Megaphone is to increase the economic success of any onchain community.

We achieve this by building a technology platform that makes it easy for you to

onchain actions for your product such as staking, lending and borrowing, or
liquidity provisioning. Distribute your brand across web2 platforms and onchain
protocols, gather insights about your contributors via anti-sybil identity
analysis, and launch, sell, and airdrop your tokens.
