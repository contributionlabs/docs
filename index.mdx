title: About Megaphone 
---

Megaphone is the easiest way to launch branded crypto campaigns, allowlists, and
airdrop claims.

Launch a Megaphone to drive community engagement, qualify wallet reputation, and
distribute tokens, all in one beautiful, bot-resistant platform.

The most common use cases for Megaphone:

1. **Viral Allowlist**: Before launching your next feature or product, give
early access to your top community contributors.
1. **Points Campaign**: Questing pages that target social engagement (X,
Discord, Telegram, etc.) and high-value onchain actions (swaps, deposits,
liquidity provisioning, etc.), with a beautiful interface that puts your brand
first.
1. **Airdrop Eligibility Checker**: Generate hype for your airdrop by allowing
users to check if they are eligible to claim, and participate in useful social
and onchain actions to earn some allocation.
1. **Token Claim**: Allow your community to claim their tokens and participate
in your onchain ecosystem.
